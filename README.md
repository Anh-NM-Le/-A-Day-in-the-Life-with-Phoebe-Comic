## Team Focus:
Graphic medicine is a growing field that focuses on how visual comunication can be used for public health purpose. Medical professionals and public health organizations have started using comics to communicate with stakeholders because the form's storytelling capabilities encourage empathy. Research has shown that patients and caregivers are more likely to pay attention to and understand information presented as a comic, rather than as an informational pamphlet. Additionally, visual storytelling and production offers opportunities to speak across language barriers, making graphic medicine a useful approach in multilingual  contexts. On this team, we will create research-based comics and other projects meant to help medical information reach broader audiences.
## Subteam: How to address questions about new assistive technology based on relationship comic
